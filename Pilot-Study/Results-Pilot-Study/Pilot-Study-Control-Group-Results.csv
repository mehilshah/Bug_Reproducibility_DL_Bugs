Similarly, the specific mention of the MNIST dataset and values of exact hyperparameters used in the process will help the bug reproduction.","The optimizer and loss variables are provided in the code snippet, but their initializations are missing. Additionally, the issue mentions handwritten digits indicating that it is the MNIST dataset, so we have to download the MNIST data, load it in the runtime and then reproduce the bug."
