I am trying to use a neural network to predict the price of houses. Here is what the top of the dataset looks like.

    Price   Beds    SqFt    Built   Garage  FullBaths   HalfBaths   LotSqFt
    485000  3       2336    2004    2       2.0          1.0        2178.0
    430000  4       2106    2005    2       2.0          1.0        2178.0
    445000  3       1410    1999    1       2.0          0.0        3049.0
I am using the ReLU activation function. When I try to evaluate my model on my test data, I get this TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +=: 'Dense' and 'str'.
I looked at the types of the columns from my original dataframe, and everything looks fine.
print(df.dtypes)
## Output
#Price          int64
#Beds           int64
#SqFt           int64
#Built          int64
#Garage         int64
#FullBaths    float64
#HalfBaths    float64
#LotSqFt      float64
#dtype: object.
I'm not sure if I am messing something up in my neural network to cause this error.
