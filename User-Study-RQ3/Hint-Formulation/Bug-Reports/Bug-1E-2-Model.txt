I have constructed an ANN in keras which has 1 input layer(3 inputs), one output layer (1 output) and two hidden layers with with 12 and 3 nodes respectively, as shown below in the code. The dataset has 4 columns: 3 columns with values in the range [60, 70] and the target variable is binary (0/1 output). so after 150 epochs i get: loss: 0.6932 - acc: 0.5000 - val_loss: 0.6970 - val_acc: 0.1429. My question is: how could i modify my NN in order to achieve higher accuracy?
